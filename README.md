# Implementing local Serverless functions deployment (Kubernetes + openfaas)

I have hosted a simple python program in to openfaas platform using Kubernetes. 

The python code take input as text and append  " printed in Open FaaS" in the end. 

Then I demonstated the function in openfaas and also a sample matric in Promethus platform.

I got idea from

Special thanks to University of Bamberg, where I have learnt the basics of these technologies.
